Project Phase 2 Summary
1. In the phase 2 of our project, we have added more elements to the existing prototype such that it loosely resembles the application at the final phase.
2. To elaborate, we have added a graphical user interface that displays the basic options that allow the end user to navigate through the application. 
3. Apart from that, the user can now try-on three different models of watches as the application provides the ability to swap the models and colours of the 3D images of the watches in real-time. 
4. In order give a more realistic effect, the dial of the watch mimics the reflective feature of the glass dial of a real watch. 
5. Moreover, the data is currently being stored offline, which will be pushed to online database in the future developments.
